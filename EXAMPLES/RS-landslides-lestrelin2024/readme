This directory "RS-landslides-lestrelin2024" is in association with the submitted manuscript "Modeling the onset of earthquake-triggered landslides on slip surfaces governed by rate-and-state friction" [Paper #2024GL110695]. 
The scripts available are commented but still in a pretty raw state. As they will be clarified and optimized for further use, this directory will be updated. Moreover, if you have any questions regarding the data or the scripts, do not hesitate to reach the author at hugo.lestrelin@hotmail.com.

This directory is divided in three :

	- “data_scripts” : provides the three python scripts we used in order to run the simulations (through sem2dpack; run_param.py) and extract/trim the output data (read+extract_param3.py). "function_read.py" is called by read+extract_param3.py and used as a toolbox in order to manipulate certain data from sem2dpack. Those scripts should be based on the most recent version of the software SEM2DPACK available at : https://github.com/jpampuero/sem2dpack. In the case where it is not working with the current version, the user can still find a compatible version in the dedicated branch "pore_pressure" : https://github.com/jpampuero/sem2dpack/tree/pore_pressure. For example, in order to reproduce the output for figure 4.a), after completing the output directory and the number of simulations wanted in run_param.py, we need to implement the main physical parameters, which can be found in the paper (Table S1). Considering a certain frequency (e.g. 1Hz), every physical parameters will be constant except for the amplitude which will increase between 0.1 to 5 m/s2. Then, we need to choose adequate numerical parameters (can depend on the precision needed or the computing power) and run this first script. This step has then to be redo for different frequencies between 0.1 and 6 Hz. After completing all those simulations, we need to run read+extract_param3.py in the correct directory with the correct parameters to look at (PGA, Frequency). A file named "data.pkl" will appear in each directory linked to each simulation, and those are the data used in the figure scripts from the directory "figure_scripts". 
	
	- “input+output” : includes some input files from Figure 4, with their respective extracted (and compressed) output data. Following the previous example in order to reproduce the output of figure 4.a), at the end this should produce around 150 - 200 Gb of data. As it is quite heavy to put all of them on github, we only choose a sample of those simulations : following a constant 2Hz frequency for the incident wave, there are data for three different PGA, 0.5, 2 and 4 m/s2.
	
	- “figure_scripts” : is the directory where we have put all the scripts we used to make our figure. For some of them, we used other software for post-production rearrangement, such as LibreOffice Draw. "fig_propres.py" has been used for the figure 5 of the main paper. "sem2dreadfault.py" is used as a toolbox in order to manipulate certain data from sem2dpack.
